##External Java Libraries
I used these  third party Java Libraries in the main function, when I try to create some users, some companys, some ads...etc, read some variables from some .txt file, then use these libraries.

No other third library used except these below. 

* java.io.BufferedReader;  
* java.io.FileNotFoundException;  
* java.io.FileReader;  
* java.io.IOException;
